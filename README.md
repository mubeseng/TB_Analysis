# TB_Analysis
Global deaths by tuberculosis in  2013
This project notebook is inspired by introdutory project task of The Open University's _Learn to code for Data Analysis_ course.

In 2000, the United Nations set eight Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce poverty and diseases, improve gender equality and environmental sustainability, etc. Each goal is quantified and time-bound, to be achieved by the end of 2015. Goal 6 is to have halted and started reversing the spread of HIV, malaria and tuberculosis (TB).
TB doesn't make headlines like Ebola, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and other epidemics, but is far deadlier. For more information, see the World Health Organisation (WHO) page <http://www.who.int/gho/tb/en/>.

Given the population and number of deaths due to TB in some countries during one year, the following questions will be answered: 

- What is the total, maximum, minimum and average number of deaths in that year?
- Which countries have the most and the least deaths?
- What is the death rate (deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) for each country?
- Which countries have the lowest and highest death rate?

The death rate allows for a better comparison of countries with widely different population sizes.
